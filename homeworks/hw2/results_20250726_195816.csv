6,What red meat is healthiest?,"While I cannot provide personalized dietary advice, generally speaking, lean cuts of red meat tend to be healthier options. Here are some of the healthiest choices:

### Lean Red Meats:
- **Skinless, lean cuts of beef**: Sirloin, tenderloin (filet mignon), top round, eye of round.
- **Pork**: Pork tenderloin, loin chops, and pork sirloin are lower in fat.
- **Lamb**: Leg of lamb (lean portions), loin chops.

### Tips for Choosing Healthier Red Meat:
- Opt for cuts with ""loin"" or ""round"" in their name.
- Trim visible fat before cooking.
- Use cooking methods like grilling, baking, or broiling instead of frying.
- Aim for portions around 3-4 ounces to keep overall fat and calorie intake in check.

Always consider your personal health, dietary preferences, and consult with a healthcare provider for tailored advice."
